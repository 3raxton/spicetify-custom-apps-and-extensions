## Notes
This extension is created by [@theRealPadster](https://github.com/theRealPadster) and hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/theRealPadster/spicetify-hide-podcasts/). Please download from there, as the version in this repo is not guaranteed to be up to date. This version of the extension just supports the new xpui (Spicetify v2+), but the legacy Spicetify v1 version is available from the main GitHub repo.
