## Contribution
This extension is primarily maintained on [hroland/spicetify-show-local-files](https://github.com/hroland/spicetify-show-local-files/)

Help is appreciated, feel free to submit PRs. Making the current solution more sophisticated, and having the sidebar item stylistically follow the other GlueDropTarget elements would be the goal.
